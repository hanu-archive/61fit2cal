Below is a list of topics to prepare for the final exam:

**I) Linear Algebra: **

1) Row reduction and Echelon form; matrix equation and solving linear systems by Gaussian elimination; 

2) Matrix operations; inverse of matrix;

3) Determinant of a matrix; Cramer's rule; solving linear systems using Cramer's rule.

I**I) [Calculus](https://lms.fit.hanu.vn/mod/resource/view.php?id=6501 "CALCULUS")**

1) [Functions of one variable](https://lms.fit.hanu.vn/mod/resource/view.php?id=12168 "Functions of one variable"): the natural domain of a function; limits, continuity; derivative; differentiation;  L'Hôpital's rule; [integration](https://lms.fit.hanu.vn/mod/resource/view.php?id=12440 "Integration") (chapter 1,2,3,7).

2)  Functions of two variables: (chapter 13) limits, continuity; partial derivatives; differentiability; maxima and minima of functions.

3) Differential equation : separable equations; linear equations.\
You can use last year's [sample test](https://lms.fit.hanu.vn/mod/resource/view.php?id=13047 "Sample test") for practice.
